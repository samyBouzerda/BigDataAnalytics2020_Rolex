More specifically, it is an _\"image classifier, which is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics\"_. So, Custom Vision will use a machine learning algorithm, such as classification, in order to recognize chosen features in provided images. The user applies oneself labels on several images, permitting the AI to train its data, permitting the user to finally test its application. \n",
